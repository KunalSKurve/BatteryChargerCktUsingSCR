# Battery Charger Circuit Using SCR
A circuit for battery charging includes an SCR that is periodically gated on for a duration corresponding to the state of charge of the battery, being gated on for a duration corresponding to the state of charge on the battery being the gated for only a short interval when the battery is essentially fully charged to keep it charged. The conduction angle is determined from the open circuited battery potential and the previous charging history of the battery obtained from potential sensing circuits. A pedestal and cosine modified ramp circuit triggers the SCR’s through capacitors with a resistor inter coupling the SCR gate and cathode electrodes. Circuitry prevents the uni-polar junction transistor in the latter circuit from remaining latched on. A potential circuit for determining the rate of charge includes a resistor connected to the output terminal that is bypassed when the average value of the signal connected on the collector of the transistor having the base connected to the output terminal having a predetermined value. Diodes inter-couple the SCR’s and the emitter of the latter transistor for providing operating potential to the circuits and the starting charging current to the output terminal when a connected battery is fully discharged.
